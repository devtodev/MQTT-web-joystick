# MQTT-web-joystick
MQTT-web-joystick

This the MQTT-web-joystic user interface and it's part of the Robotic IoT starter kit.

Clone this repository and edit mqtt.html with your personal mqtt broker hostname and port.

    var wsbroker = "test.mosquitto.org";  //mqtt websocket enabled broker
    var wsport = 8080 // port for above
    
It will use by default the Mosquitto free server, which works well, but there is no support or guarantee on it.
